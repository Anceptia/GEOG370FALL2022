    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</p>I displayed the map in different projections using QGIS by using the Natural Earth Vector dataset. I used the ne_10m_admin_0_countries layer for each map and used the Indicatrix Mapper to get the Latitude and Longitude and used the Project Propertities (CRS) to import each ESPG map.
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The biggest disadvantage of WGS84 is that it appears to be "flat" and is a more difficult setup for map applications. WGS84 is advantageous because it is one of the most commonly used projections and gives a more accurate appearance of the world map</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>I observed that this map is more rounded and the cicrcles from the graticule are closer together at the top and bottom of the map. An advantage would be is that its scale is correct along the equator and the central meridian. A disadvantage is that its areas, shapes, and distances, and angles are disorted. The area is inaccurate and only best on spheres</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>I observed that this map is centered on Greenwich and is more cylindrical. An advantage of this map is that its meridians are vertical lines and are parallel and equally spaced. The graticule is also symmetric across the equator and central meridian. A disadvantage to this map is that its distorted toward the polar regions.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I</h2>
    <h3>I observed that this map is centered on Greenwich. An advantage of this map is that the parallels on the Graticule are equally distributed straight lines perpendicular to the central meridian. A disadvantage is that this map is disorted in terms of its areas, distances, directions, and angles. The higher latitude areas are exaggerated and the meridians are more disorted towards the edges of the projection.</h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>I observed that this map presents the world as more of a rectangular shape. An advantage of this map is that the meridians are vertical lines and parallel to each other and equally spaced. The lines of latitude are horizontal straight lines and are perpendicular to meridians. The graticule is also symmetric across the equator and the central meridian. A disadvantage is that shapes are distorted north and south between the standard parallels.</h3>

    </h2> style="color:red">Now, you should add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
